This program focuses on recursive backtracking. Turn in a file named Anagrams.java through LATTE. You will need support files AnagramMain.java, LetterInventory.java and various dictionary text files from LATTE; place them in the same folder as your class.

Anagrams:

An anagram is a word or phrase made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, the words ‚Äúmidterm‚Äù and ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù are anagrams. If you ignore spaces and capitalization and allow multiple words, a multi-word phrase can be an anagram of some other word or phrase. For example, the phrases ‚ÄúClint Eastwood‚Äù and ‚Äúold west action‚Äù are anagrams.

In this assignment, you will create a class called Anagrams that uses a dictionary to find all anagram phrases that match a given word or phrase. You are provided with a client program AnagramMain that prompts the user for phrases and then passes those phrases to your Anagrams object. It asks your object to print all anagrams for those phrases. Below is a sample log of execution, wrapped into two columns (user input is underlined):

Implementation Details:

Your Anagrams class must have the following public constructor and methods:

public Anagrams(Set&lt;String&gt; dictionary)

In this constructor you should initialize a new anagram solver over the given dictionary of words. You may assume that the words in the set are in alphabetical order. Do not modify the set passed to your constructor.

You should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the set passed is null.

public Set&lt;String&gt; getWords(String phrase)

In this method you should return a set containing all words from the dictionary that can be made using some or all of the letters in the given phrase, in alphabetical order. For example, if your anagram solver is using the dictionary corresponding to dict1.txt and you are passed the phrase ‚ÄúBarbara Bush‚Äù, you should return a set containing the elements [abash, aura, bar, barb, brush, bus, hub, rub, shrub, sub].

You should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the string is null.

<pre>public void print(String phrase)
</pre>
In this method you should use recursive backtracking to find and print all anagrams that can be formed using all of the letters of the given phrase, in the same order and format as in the example log on the previous page. For example, if your anagram solver is using the dictionary corresponding to dict1.txt and you are passed the phrase ‚Äúhairbrush‚Äù, your method should produce the following output:

<pre>[bar, huh, sir]
[bar, sir, huh]
[briar, hush]
[huh, bar, sir]
[huh, sir, bar]
[hush, briar]
[sir, bar, huh]
[sir, huh, bar]
</pre>
You should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the string is null. An empty string generates no output.

<pre>public void print(String phrase, int max)
</pre>
In this method you should use recursive backtracking to find and print all anagrams that can be formed using all of the letters of the given phrase and that include at most max words total, in the same order and format as in the example log on the previous page. For example, if your anagram solver is using the dictionary corresponding to dict1.txt and this method is passed a phrase of ‚Äúhairbrush‚Äù and a max of 2, your method should produce the following output:

<pre>[briar, hush]
[hush, briar]
</pre>
If max is 0, print all anagrams regardless of how many words they contain. For example, if using the same dictionary and passed a phrase of ‚Äúhairbrush‚Äù and a max of 0, the output is the same as that shown earlier on this page with no max.

You should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the string is null or if the max is less than 0. An empty string generates no output.

The provided GrammarMain program calls your methods in a 1-to-1 relationship, calling getWords every time before calling print. But you should not assume any particular order of calls by the client. Your code should still work if the methods are called in any order, any number of times.

Recursive Algorithm:

Generate all anagrams of a phrase using recursive backtracking. Many backtracking algorithms involve examining all combinations of a set of choices. In this problem, the choices are the words that can be formed from the phrase. A ‚Äúdecision‚Äù involves choosing a word for part of the phrase and recursively choosing words for the rest of the phrase. If you find a collection of words that use up all of the letters in the phrase, it should be printed as output.

Part of your grade will be based on efficiency. One way to implement this program would be to consider every word in the dictionary as a possible ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù However, this would lead to a massive decision tree with lots of useless paths and a slow program. Therefore for full credit, to improve efficiency when generating anagrams for a given phrase, you must first find the collection of words contained in that phrase and consider only those words as ‚Äúchoices‚Äù in your decision tree. You should also implement the second print method so that it backtracks immediately once it exceeds the max.

The following diagram shows a partial decision tree for generating anagrams of the phrase ‚Äúbarbara bush‚Äù. Notice that some paths of the recursion lead to dead ends. For example, if the recursion chooses ‚Äúaura‚Äù and ‚Äúbarb‚Äù, the letters remaining to use are [bhs], and no choice available uses these letters, so it is not possible to generate any anagrams beginning with those two choices. In such a case, your code should backtrack and try the next path.

One difference between this algorithm and other backtracking algorithms is that the same word can appear more than once in an anagram. For example, from ‚Äúbarbara bush‚Äù you might extract the word ‚Äúbar‚Äù twice.

LetterInventory Class:

An important aspect of simplifying the solution to many backtracking problems is the separation of recursive code from code that manages low-level details of the problem. The low-level details for anagrams involve keeping track of letters and figuring out when one group of letters can be formed from another. We are providing you a class called LetterInventory to help with this task.

A LetterInventory object represents the count of each letter from A-Z found in a given string (ignoring whitespace, capitalization,ornon-alphabeticcharacters). Forexample,aLetterInventoryforthestring‚ÄùHellothere‚Äùwould keep count of 3 Es, 2 Hs, 2 Ls, 1 O, 1 R, and 1 T. The toString of this inventory would be ‚Äú[eeehhllort]‚Äù.

You can add and subtract phrases from a LetterInventory and ask whether an inventory contains a phrase. For example, adding ‚Äúhi ho!‚Äù to the above inventory would produce ‚Äú[eeehhhhilloort]‚Äù. Subtracting ‚Äúhe he he‚Äù from this would produce ‚Äú[hilloort]‚Äù. If we asked whether this inventory .contains(‚Äútool‚Äù), the result is true.

Your print method must produce the anagrams in the same format as in the log. The easiest way to do this is to build up your answer in a list, stack, or other collection. Then you can println the collection and it will have the right format.

The provided AnagramMain program can read its input from different dictionary files. It is initially set to use a very small dictionary dict1.txt to make testing easier. But once your code works with this dictionary, you should test it with larger dictionaries such as the provided dict2.txt and dict3.txt.

One difficult part of this program is the second version of print that limits the number of words that can appear in the anagrams. We suggest you do this part last, initially printing all anagrams regardless of the number of words.
